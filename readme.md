# TWB2TC
This script aims to convert TWBlue soundpacks to TweeseCake compatible ones.

## Usage
Run the script. It will ask you to paste in a path to a directory of sounds from a TWBlue soundpack to use. After this, it will create a folder next to the python script named the name of the soundpack folder, with _tc appended to the end of it. Say your soundpack was called classic. The folder for the TC soundpack would be named classic_tc. Upon completion, it will tell you how many sounds were converted in total, along with the total number of sounds in the original soundpack.

## Todo
* automatically convert ogg files to wav files
* Substitute sounds that don't exist in the TWBlue soundpack for TC default sounds or something.
